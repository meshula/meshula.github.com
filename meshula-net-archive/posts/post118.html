In live action film, pre-viz is becoming more and more accepted as a tool throughout the creative process and for some productions, it is quickly taking over the role of storyboards. Pre-Viz is also powerful tool for problem solving and brainstorming. There are more and more instances of pre-viz shots being handed off to effects animation for finaling, although the practice is not yet common place.</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>In feature animation however, the role of pre-viz is still being defined. The tasks accomplished in pre-viz have traditionally been the domain of the layout department and storyboarders. Pre-viz has typically picked up from storyboards and been a means to generate early reels for hand off to animation. Dreamworks' D-viz concept is to use pre-visualization as a problem solving tool early in the production process, as an integration to the traditional layouts stage. They're calling it D-viz for design visualization. The idea is to move modeling, surfacing, lighting and blocked animation into the pre-visualization tool set so that the the creative process unfolds in an integrated virtual world.</p> <p>It's very exciting watch these ideas and concepts become mainstream.</p> <p>For more, VFX World's series on pre-visualization continues with an <a href="http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&amp;id=3411&amp;page=1">insightful piece</a> on Dreamworks' D-Viz.</p>
