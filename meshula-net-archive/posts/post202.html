<p>I'm struck by the correspondence between pre-Renaissance recipes for creating the Philosopher's Stone and the modern process of extracting gold from ore. The first stamp mills were built more than a thousand years ago; it occurred to me that the instructions for the transmutation of gold might have been a practical recipe actually employed in ancient stamp mills. Lacking a modern chemical science and nomenclature as we now know it, and desiring to protect their trade secrets, they might have couched their steps in bizarre metaphor, only understandable to a guildsman or acolyte - it wouldn't do for everyone to be able to produce gold! For further protection they might have scrambled the order of the steps.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The seven steps in the process, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Tablet">Hermes Trimestigus' Emerald Tablet</a> and conventionally interpreted are:</p> <ol> <li>Calcination - a thermal or chemical treatment to cause decomposition of ore <li>Dissolution - dissolving a substance to yield a solution <li>Separation - transform a mixture or solution into distinct products <li>Conjunction - recombination of the products into a new substance <li>Fermentation - creation of an amalgam for the strengthening of the product <li>Distillation - the boiling and condensation of the product to increase its purity <li>Coagulation - the final precipitation or sublimation of the product.</li></ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At the stamp mill, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill-Crowe_process">Merrill-Crowe gold and silver recovery process</a> is employed.</p> <ol> <li>Calcination, The ore is crushed <li>Conjunction - The crushed ore is passed over mercury swept onto wide copper plates; the mercury combines with gold and silver in the ore forming an amalgam. <li>Dissolution - The amalgam is dissolved in cyanide to create the pregnant solution. <li>Fermentation - Chemical processes are applied to purify the solution. <li>Distillation - Mechanical and thermal processes are applied to purify the solution. <li>Separation - Zinc is introduced to the solution; since mercury has a higher affinity for the zinc, all the gold and silver recovered through the process is... <li>Coagulation - precipitated out in a pure state.</li></ol> <p>In an alternative process at some stamp mills including at Bodie, the gold is recovered by evaporating the mercury. At Bodie, the Merrill-Crowe process was a secondary process applied to ore remaining after the simpler initial process.</p> <p>A speculative point I would make is that from the point of view of the ancient alchemists it might have appeared to them that their process actually transmuted base ore into gold and silver; it certainly looks that way today when you are at the mine looking at the raw ore.</p> <p>There's much debate about the order and meaning of the alchemical steps in the transmutation of gold; but Merrill-Crowe has it definitively worked out, it's a trade secret no longer! I recognize that there is also a large body of philosophical work associated with the philosopher's stone, it is probable that the ancients attempted to encode many layers of information into their recipes - the method for the production of gold was only one of many intellectual endeavors that had to be hidden in the Middle Ages; here I am showing that the alchemical process was actually a practical and important precursor to modern science.</p> <p>P.S. Of course, these assignations to the alchemical steps are mine, someone with better chemical or mining knowledge than myself might do it differently, and maybe the Emerald Tablet steps are actually correct.</p> <p>P.P.S., in case you're curious where this tangent comes from, one of my hobbies is the study of the history of science.</p>
