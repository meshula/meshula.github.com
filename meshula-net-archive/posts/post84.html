<p><a href="./download/aquattack.zip">Aquattack</a> - a Colecovision game I created back in 1984. Back in those days, one person wrote the code, created the music, did all the graphics, and the animation. This game is long out of print and has never been released in any retro-compilation.</p> <p><img src="../../posts/aquattack.jpg"></p> <p><a href="./download/AMFormat.htm">Animation Master file format</a>. This is the format for version 5 or thereabouts, but it still gets a lot of downloads.</p> <p>I've obtained permission from the author to host the classic 3ds <a href="./download/view3ds.zip">viewing app and its source code</a> here.</p> <p>The source code for a 68k forth interpreter/compiler called <a href="./download/FusionForth68k.zip">Fusion Forth</a> that Don Palmer and I wrote. It has some Atari ST specific extensions in it, but it is really easy to port to any 68k based embedded system. Also included are an IDE, some graphic demos, a font editor, and a text editor, all written in Forth. Despite being created for the Atari ST, the code is still a good read if you've ever been curious about how a threaded interpreter is built from the ground up.</p> <p><a href="./download/MLShell.html">ML Shell</a>&nbsp;is a simple windows shell that implements a DLL based plug in mechanism.</p> <p>Finally, <a href="./download/OptionParser.h">OptionParser.h</a> and <a href="./download/OptionParser.cpp">OptionParser.cpp</a> give you an extremely easy to use C++ command line parser modeled after the OptionParser module that comes with Python. It also includes a few commonly needed stl string functions such as Split and Join.</p>
