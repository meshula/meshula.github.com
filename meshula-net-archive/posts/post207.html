<p>Prowling the physics blogs, I came across a bit of <a href="http://telescoper.wordpress.com/2008/09/27/intimations-of-immortality-from-a-little-red-book/">bibliophilic detective work</a> capped with a quote from a Wordsworth poem. It inspired me to look a bit farther, and I found the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ode:_Intimations_of_Immortality">whole poem here</a>.</p> <p>The first stanza says</p> <blockquote> <p><em>There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,<br>The earth, and every common sight,<br>To me did seem<br>Appareled in celestial light,<br>The glory and the freshness of a dream<br>It is not now as it hath been of yore-<br>Turn whereso'er I may,<br>By night or day,<br>The things which I have seen I now can see no more.</em></p></blockquote> <p>Like my friend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Steacy">Ken Steacy</a>, I like to say "I'm twelve years old from the neck up." Wordsworth suggests what that could mean if I were to really realize it. He goes on to mourn that he knows a glory has passed from the Earth; with maturity and the burdens of responsibility comes a loss of the naivety that gave us such easy pleasure when we were young.</p> <blockquote> <p>The Rainbow comes and goes,<br>And lovely is the Rose,<br>The Moon doth with delight<br>Look round her when the heavens are bare,<br>Waters on a starry night<br>Are beautiful and fair;<br>The sunshine is a glorious birth;<br>But yet I know, where'er I go,<br>That there hath past away a glory from the earth. <p>... <p>The Pansy at my feet<br>Doth the same tale repeat:<br>Whither is fled the visionary gleam?<br>Where is it now, the glory and the dream?</p></blockquote> <p>With later years and comprehension comes the realization that what was lost is still there -</p> <blockquote> <p>Then sing, ye Birds, sing, sing a joyous song!<br>And let the young Lambs bound<br>As to the tabor's sound!<br>We in thought will join your throng,<br>Ye that pipe and ye that play,<br>Ye that through your hearts today<br>Feel the gladness of the May!<br>What though the radiance which was once so bright<br>Be now forever taken from my sight,<br>Though nothing can bring back the hour<br>Of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower;<br>We will grieve not, rather find<br>Strength in what remains behind;<br>In the primal sympathy<br>Which having been must ever be;<br>In the soothing thoughts that spring<br>Out of human suffering;<br>In the faith that looks through death,<br>In years that bring the philosophic mind. <p>... <p>Thanks to the human heart by which we live,<br>Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,<br>To me the meanest flower that blows can give<br>Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.</p></blockquote> <p>And he leaves us with the thought that our innocent state of mind can be reclaimed.</p>
