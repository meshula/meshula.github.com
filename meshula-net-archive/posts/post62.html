The meme is spreading. Quoting Ubisoft Montreal CEO Yannis Mallat: <blockquote>"We have a vision of convergence. We think that crossing the processes, sharing the tools, and having [different groups of] people working on the same kind of product will make this happen. As we know quite well how to make video games, now is the time for us to take it to the next level in terms of CG products. This is what we are doing with the creation of Ubisoft Digital Arts Studio. It's going to be a product where real-time will meld with prerendered, and it will merge into one thing that we are about to shape thanks to the capabilities of the next-gen machines coming soon." <a title="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1469/bridging_the_filmgame_divide_.php" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1469/bridging_the_filmgame_divide_.php">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1469/bridging_the_filmgame_divide_.php</a></blockquote> They mention our efforts at LucasArts, which is a bit of thrill for me - the word is getting out. It would be nice if the article had some more specifics - it seems like Ubi is still working out exactly what it means when all these different disciplines and business goals come together. Information is still thin on the ground on this new studio past their first animated short based on Assassin's Creed.
