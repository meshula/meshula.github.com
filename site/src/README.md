# त्रित्रयम् Website Source

Root source directory for the त्रित्रयम् research website built with Astro.

## Directory Structure

├── components/     # Reusable Astro components
├── layouts/        # Page layout templates
├── content/        # Content collections (papers, guides)

## Development Notes

- **Pages**: File-based routing - .astro, .md, .mdx files become routes
- **Components**: Reusable UI components for consciousness visualizers
- **Layouts**: Base templates for different content types
- **Content**: Markdown files with frontmatter, organized by type
- **Styles**: Contemplative design system and typography

## Building

```bash
npm run dev      # Development server
npm run build    # Production build to ../dist/
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

*This directory structure embodies triadic organization - stable layouts (Memory), dynamic pages (Motion), and content collections (Field).*
