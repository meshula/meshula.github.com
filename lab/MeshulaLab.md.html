Meshula Lab
-------------

Meshula Lab is a hybrid realitme and offline authoring and playback system for linear and interactive media.

Streamlined iterative production processes driven by a workflow schema

Interoperabiity with third party systems via Pixar's Universal Scene Description

Well defined distributed heterogeneous system integration through a consistent FFI and RPC

Secure block chain transacted asset revision, tracking, and rights across networked systems

Desktop and virtual authoring environment and playback systems


# Production Platform

A production management dashboard, and a work schema defining content creation, assembly, and deployment.

Production management includes task tracking and workflow analysis of historical
data, defined per production via workflow schemas.

# Creation infrastructure

- asset dependency tracking and validation.
- Automatic creation of production artifacts such as sides
- localization automation
- iterative asset development from specification through prototype and delivery

# Assembly Infrastructure

- heavily leverages Pixar's Universal Scene Description
- distributed asset storage replicated with eventual consistency
- LabWorkbench tool development infrastructure https://github.com/meshula/LabWorkbench
- deskop UI, and performance interfaces for authoring of layout, animation, and sequencing
- heterogeneous distributed collaborative workflow environment

# Deployment

- Meshula Lab incorporates its own realtime playback engine, but can transport files to other playback systems such as third party game engines.
