Copyright 1999-2017 Nick Porcino, all rights reserved



Meshula Lab is a hybrid realitme and offline authoring and playback system for linear and interactive media.

Streamlined iterative production processes driven by a workflow schema

Interoperabiity with third party systems via Pixar's Universal Scene Description

Well defined distributed heterogeneous system integration through a consistent FFI and RPC

Secure block chain transacted asset revision, tracking, and rights across networked systems

Desktop and virtual authoring environment and playback systems


# Production Platform

A production management dashboard, and a work schema defining content creation, assembly, and deployment.

Production management includes task tracking and workflow analysis of historical
data, defined per production via workflow schemas.

# Creation infrastructure

- asset dependency tracking and validation.
- Automatic creation of production artifacts such as sides
- localization automation
- iterative asset development from specification through prototype and delivery

# Assembly Infrastructure

- heavily leverages Pixar's Universal Scene Description
- distributed asset storage replicated with eventual consistency
- LabWorkbench tool development infrastructure
- deskop UI, and performance interfaces for authoring of layout, animation, and sequencing
- heterogeneous distributed collaborative workflow environment

# Deployment

- Meshula Lab incorporates its own realtime playback engine, but can transport files to other playback systems such as third party game engines.

simultaneous multi-site collaboration

a new platform




Combine the revolutionary scene layering and management technology of Pixar's USD

with the greatest rendering technology available

and use the knowledge and experience of leading edge artists, directors, actors, storytellers, and engineers

to make the most intuitive, exciting, open, powerful, and beautiful content creation environment ever

available to everyone



1.
The greatest platform for producing interactive and narrative content

    - What's different about it?

        It combines
            world beating scene management technology from Pixar
            advanced sensing technologies of the latest mobile devices
            a secure collaboration platform built on blockchains
            pipeline methodologies representing decades of practice

        The platform is
            open, fast, small, secure, focussed

    - How will that make any money?

        It enables #2.

    - Why is it open?

        Collaboration with the best artists, directors, and technologists in the
        world ensures absolutely that the best minds in the world are improving
        the platform

2.
The greatest environment for producting interactive and narrative content

    - What's different about it?

        It combines a physical production space with remote collaboration features

        A production environment where an interactive or narrative experience can be
        built at the speed of improvisation and creativity

        Best in industry workflow, security, and pipeline

        AI gaffers accelerate common and repetitive tasks

        The content bridge publishes content to linear and interactive formats

    - How will it make any money?

        It is franchised. It's built upon the open platform. The environment is open
        for collaboration within the franchise.

        There is a set up kit, training manuals, bot and human based support, and
        a persistent community forum, showcase, and store.






BONEYARD
=========

Intended to streamline the planning, production, delivery, and localization of
products

The integrated use of database, document browsing, and integration tools makes relevant
information available to everyone on a project, from planners and managers to
artists and engineers.

Information is not duplicated, but hyperlinked to available appropriately where needed

Access is possible from standard browsers, and bespoke applications. Data is hyperlinked.

New projects are created from a template that immediately set up standard and
required sections.

Documents are access controlled, and blockchained for security and accountability

schedule and milestone views
----------------------------

milestone definitions feed workflow template through work schema

documentation
-------------

as concept documents become available, they are added to the system, then refined
right up to beta. Design documents follow concept, functional spec follows design.

Each level of documentation refers forward and back to the other through links

as the document refines the concept, the functional spec will come into play as
individual assets are work elements are specified. The functional spec is the
primary view into the production database, and the production database is the
roadmap to the work. This is key for production and project management.

documents are not rolled together into a single evolving document because each
document has a specific use and amalgamation is counter productive. concept
documents have many lives and many users beyond the ship of a product. Design
documents are critical during implementation, and burdening them with functional
information means production people will spend too much time sorting through to
find what they actually need.

derivative versions
--------------------

localized versions, marketing deliverables such as screenshots and demo versions,
OEM bundles, and so on, are all branched from the mother data lines.

Significant changes can involve a complete divergent fork of the system database,
still linked via the blockchain.

The script (screenplay) is integrated into the chain, facilitating the output of
sides other production-useful variants. Work bundles for localization are
automated. Automated ingest of ADR sessions is possible.

Functional design and design document are utliized by QA to create a testing
protocol and plan. Bug tracking and reported are tracked in a more conventional
quality control system.

History logs are automatically generated and accessible via the chain. A digest
is available for review and filtering.

concept template
----------------

The Pitch - scripts, presentation boards, mockups, functional prototypes, session notes

Product Mission - market need addressed, and how the need is addressed

Hooks

Synergies - day and date feature releases, bundling considerations

Complexity - time - cost - quantity prism declared here, indicating which
parameters are fixed

Risks and Assumptions

Anciliary Components - online components, technical support components, demos, updates

Product Variations

Language SKUs


capsule summary
---------------

A well written capsule summary makes anyone feel they can understand the product.
Capsule pitches often refer to other products in order to quickly frame the new
product.

sparse reference for managers, marketing, and others who need to quickly understand the product

Title, Category, Platforms, Release date

Background - context for understanding product's palcement

AUdience -

Hooks

Elevator Pitch

e.g.

Bunny Hill, Playstation 4, Q4/17

Background: In this sequal to last year's creepy adventure title, players control
a girl with a split personality, not that scary, except for that the fact
that her other personality is a special operative, and she's next on the list.

Target Audience: Due to subject matter, teens and adults

Hooks: The alternate personality is played from first person, leading to a dawning
realization that the mission objective is only visible in mirrors.

Pitch: High gore and scream factor, psychological twist, plus adventure elements,
make this well suited to the Resident Evil set.


Overview document
-------------------

World - settings, including artists conceptions and color models. A prose portrait
giving a general feel

Functionality - prose portrait general indicating the essence of the experience

Characters - list of characters, and an explanation of both why they are there
and how they interact with the experience

Props and Elements - general list of major props and experience mechanics. This
section is intended to help gauge production and fucntional Complexity

Scoring and Rewards - if scoring and rewards are part of the experience they are
briefly outlined here as well as an indication of general frequency of occurence

Leveling - if the experience has leveling or difficult variants, the manner of
manifestation is broadly detailed here


Target Audience
---------------

There are two aspects to consider, the person who is engaging in the experience,
and the person who purchases it.

Experiential - demographic, concurrency

Guide - the experience may be guided, by a host, a parent, or an avatar

Purchaser - consideration to the person making a purchase on behalf of someone else
