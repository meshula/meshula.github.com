# Rabid Space Monkeys, Architecture Astronauts, George Lucas, and Me

Written by Rabid Space Monkeys is a phrase I sometimes use to describe a 
system written by programmers in way over their heads, characterized by
false starts, strange conventions, spiraling complexity, slow downs,
memory bloat, and bugs, bugs, bugs. Rabid Space Monkeys are driven by the
need to add features, work around problems, and show flashy progress to
justify continuing. Rabid Space Monkeys never take a step back to 
understand what's going wrong, they build more code to compensate for 
problems, introduce new unanticipated problems, and the problems compound.
The system uses more memory and gets slower. it's the same syndrome, across 
the industry, that makes your machine feel slower and more crashy every 
year even you've got the fastest computer yet made.

In his "Meta" keynote last week, John Carmack talked about Architecture 
Astronauts. Architecture Astronauts are attracted as if to a honey pot to
the latest libraries, problem domains, paradigms; the latest way out there 
shiny thing, and they induce the same syndrome. A lack of deep introspection
and understanding leads them to introduce elegant new paradigms over the
old ones, complexity upon complexity. Systems get slower, memory bloats,
unanticipated interactions compound problems.

Architecture Astronauts and Rabid Space Monkeys go hand in hand, and it's 
why software tends to be absolutely awful fundamentally.

I worked with George Lucas on an amazing virtual production system for 
several years. If you can look at patents, you can get a peek at it here:

Perhaps surprisingly, George was an amazing mentor to an engineer. One of
the things he taught me was how to manage the complexity of a project and
avoid the syndrome; I think about what he said all the time.

"You're an engineer, you like to put things in. I'm an editor, I like to 
cut them out, maybe put them somewhere else. To build something great like
this, you need an engineer, and an editor."

He went on, "your inclination is to keep inventing. I want to keep moving
things around. If you don't put stuff in, I've got nothing to cut. We need 
each other."

I try to keep virtual George looking over my shoulder when I work.
