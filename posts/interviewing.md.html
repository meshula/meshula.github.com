Technical phone screen
-----------------------

The phone screen should filter for candidates with domain knowledge and
enthusiasm. It should screen for foundational technical competence. It
should filter for fundamental cultural mismatches.

1. Brief introduction
    - your role, the position to be filled
    - note that you've read their resume, and that this is a technical screen
1. Domain knowledge
    - find one relevant topic that they can speak confidently and competently on
1. Competence in C++ (or other language as appropriate)
    - Ask for a self assessment, then deep dive accordingly
    - If C++
         - subtleties of virtual
         - how does a vtable work
         - how do you write a comparison operator that properly sorts a vec3 into a std::set
1. Basic linear algebra and math
    - Suggested questions
        - common uses of dot and cross
        - In a 2d game with a tank, how can I determine if a target is to the left or right?
        - common uses of the determinant
    - doesn't claim it's impossible to understand quaternions
    - does not ever say "I just Google it"
1. Ability to describe basic concurrency concepts
    - deadlock
    - semaphores, mutexes, condition variables
1. For graphics
    - expertise in their graphics API of choice
    - the rendering equation
    - explain what a solid angle is
    - the difference between radiance and irradiance
1. for engines
    - describe the responsibilities of a game engine versus game play code
    - describe the game loop
    - describe how an AI system and a physics system might interact
1. for pipeline
    - describe how a character gets from a DCC to an engine

In person
---------

The in person interview should confirm the findings of the phone screen. Fundamentally,
the in person interview should ascertain aptitude, alignment, and fit.

Say a little bit about yourself and your role.
   - Provide enough context that the candidate knows how to speak to you and what about

Say a little bit about the role to be filled.
   - Give the candidate an opportunity to know how to frame their responses

Ask what attracted the candidate to the company and the role
   - They should reveal interest, enthusiasm, and preparation
   - This is an opportunity for them to pitch why they're ideal for the role

Ask about responsibilities during the last couple of years
   - Establish what they actually did
   - Do they give credit and get enthusiastic about the work of others?
   - Describe something really amazing that a colleague did
   - Try to understand how they were expected to work with others, and how that went

Ask about a conflictual situation and how they resolved it
   - Technical disagreement, or teamwork issues are fine
   - Screen for empathy, respect for others
   - Listen for behavioral red flags such as blaming and projection

What was a particularly challenging or interesting task, and how did you solve it?
   - Opportunity to bring it back to technical, and dial back tension if it arose
   - Let them show off a little

What kinds of projects do you work on your own time?
   - Learn what they're really interested in
   - Look for adaptability, initiative, and self-motivation

What do you hope to be doing five years from now?
   - Is that a compatible path with internal opportunities?
   - Will they be constantly yearning to be somewhere else?

If there technicals seem good, but you still haven't found core enthusiasm
   - Ask them to pitch to explain how they believe they will augment the team

Give them an opportunity to ask questions, but don't drag it out.

Comparing Notes
---------------

To get directly to the point ask whether anyone wants to pitch for a must hire,
or an outright reject.

If the mood is generally positive, ask for examples of attributes that stood out,
either positive or negative.
