Black Mirror Rubric
===================

We've been aware for some time that there's a disconnect between technology as an art, and technology as a practice. Famously, the Jurassic Park mathematician Ian Malcolm said -

*Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didnâ€™t stop to think if they should.*

<div style="text-align: right">- Michael Crichton</div>

Crichton's Challenge gives a sense of what we should be thinking about when we consider technology, but it doesn't give us the tools to evaluate a technology concretely in terms that might help decision makers.

This paper develops a rubric to that end.

Contraindications
-----------------

Some controversial technology development is justified by
practitioners through various arguments; this paper argues
those justifications are contraindications, and don't help to
address Crichton's challenge. Some of those justifications include:

- Ubiquity

   There are already killer robots, so it's fine if I make killer robots

- Inevitability

  If I don't make killer robots, someone else will anyway

- Denial of Agency

  Someone else told me to build killer robots

- Denial of Responsibility

  Killer robots don't kill people, the AI in the killer robots kills people

- Profiteering

  Killer robots pay big money. That money will be allocated and I deserve that money as much as anyone.

The Black Mirror Rubric
-----------------------

The episodic show Black Mirror takes technological artifacts and trends and projects them to extreme, dystopic ends. This rubric is named for the show. It provides tools for analysing a technology or trend. The output of the rubric will be a considered list of possible outcomes, to be used as an input to the decision process.

The rubric is a matrix, combining two critical dimensions; impact and reach. Impact describes what the technology affects, whether it's the weight of a wearable on the wrist, or clearing land to build a data center. Reach describes the magnitude of the impact, from impacting a single person, to impacting everyone.

Impact
------

- Somatic

  Affects on the body.

- Emotional

  Affects on feeling, mode, a sense of wellbeing

- Psychic

  Affects on judgement, ability to remember, learn, or reason

- Existential

  Affects on the environment

Reach
-----

- Individual

  Affects a single individual

- Tribe

  Affects a group of related individuals

- Society

  Affects the society in which an individual or tribe in embedded

- Universal

  Affects everyone, irrespective of society

Arranged in a chart, the evaluative matrix appears like this:

|                | Individual | Tribe | Society | Universal |
| --------------:| -----------| ------|---------|-----------|
| **Somatic**    |            |       |         |           |
| **Emotional**  |            |       |         |           |
| **Psychic**    |            |       |         |           |
| **Existential**|            |       |         |           |

It's meant as a framework for thought, and can be filled out as completely as necessary to start to understand a technology, whether it should be undertaken, and how the risks can be discovered.

Conversely, the matrix can also be used as a light mirror to brainstorm and qualify positive aspects.
