Last Will & Testament of Domenico Paschal Porcino and Kyoko Asahina Porcino 

2025 March 17

Being of sound mind and body we do declare, that should one of us precede the other the surviving spouse shall be beneficiary of all properties and holdings.

Should neither survive our two daughters, Natsuko Robin Porcino and Tsubasa Marian Porcino shall be equal beneficiaries of all properties and holdings, and jointly executors of the estate. Such properties include 162 Vida Ct in Novato, and 1426 Taunton St in Victoria, as well as various investment holdings.

Natalina and Marcus Sabathil are named as backup executors. If they are unable or unwilling to serve, any of Domenico Porcino's surviving siblings shall act as executors.

The executors shall have full authority to manage the estate, including selling assets, settling debts, distributing holdings, and making necessary financial decisions.

Any assets not otherwise specified in this will shall be distributed at the discretion of the executors. Items of cultural or historical significance should be donated to a university or museum, with the University of Victoria and the Royal British Columbia Museum as first choices. All remaining assets may be managed, sold, or disposed of as the executors see fit.

All intellectual property housed under the meshula accounts on GitHub and GitLab shall be assigned to the University of Victoria in British Columbia.

The plush turtle and bear are to be kept by a surviving daughter.

These instructions are to be interpreted as not conflicting with beneficiary assignments in investment holdings.

This will is signed by the testators in the presence of two witnesses, in accordance with the laws of California and British Columbia.
