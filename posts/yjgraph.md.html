YJ Graph 18
------------

YJ Graph 2018 brings together the world’s premier creators of digital visual effects, animation, and interactive experiences.

Scientists, engineers, artists, and producers share ideas, insights, and techniques that bring innovation to real-world production.

## Call for Papers

We invite submissions on any topic that demonstrates an impact on digital motion picture production or interactive content creation. Topics of interest include:

- computer graphics research: rendering, simulation, animation, etc.
- emerging production technologies: cinematic VR, virtual production, etc.
- practical production processes: pipelines, production management, the artist-engineer partnership.
- The best talks encourage discussion and leave the audience inspired to explore further. We encourage code sharing whenever possible. Talks should not be sales pitches or product promotions, nor should they be primarily production overviews. Each presentation should be grounded in some way in practical production experience.

We encourage submissions from diverse and underrepresented voices within the visual effects and digital content creation industry.

Each submission should convey:

- The key idea or innovation
- Technical substance and detail
- Associated production experience
- Insights and lessons learned
- Submissions may take the form of a technical paper or an extended abstract with associated visual material. Novel proposals and formats are welcome, but submissions must provide sufficient technical detail to demonstrate relevance to the audience. Presentations are generally 25 minutes, including Q&A.

Written material should be submitted in PDF form; videos should be Quicktime, MPEG, or AVI. Accepted papers will be both presented at the symposium and published in the ACM Digital Library.

YJ Graph 2018 will be held in Red Rock Canyon, Nevada, on Saturday, August 25, 2018. However, please note that the publication date for accepted papers will be Friday, August 10, 2018 to enable digital download by attendees.

Accepted submissions will receive one complimentary registration and “student early” pricing for additional authors.

Submission Deadline: Friday, May 25, 2018, 11:59pm PDT (UTC-7:00)
